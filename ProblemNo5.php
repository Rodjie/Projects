<!-- The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is, 12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385
The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is, (1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025
Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640. Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum. -->


<!-- a = 338350 -->
<!-- b = 25502500 -->

<?php
$a = 0;  // Sum of Square
$b = 0;  // Square of Sum

for( $i = 1; $i <= 100; $i++ )

  $a += $i * $i;
  $b += $i;
}

$b = $b * $b;
$c  = $b - $a;

<!--Difference: 25164150 -->
